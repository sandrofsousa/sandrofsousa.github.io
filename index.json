His MSc involved the use of a graph-based approach to quantify the topology changes of Sao Paulo’s public transport network over different spatial scales while tested the robustness of the system over simulated attacks. Before joining the research career, he had completed a postgraduate course in Business intelligence and had worked in the Information Technology field for more than 7 years.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://sandrofsousa.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"Sandro Sousa is computer scientist interested in emergent phenomena in complex systems, spatial networks, population dynamics, segregation and mobility as well as a graph and data driven quantification of these phenomena.\nCurrently, he is a PhD Candidate in Complex Systems at School of Mathematical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London, with supervision by Vincenzo Nicosia.

We propose two non-parametric measures of spatial variance and local spatial diversity, based on the statistical properties of the trajectories of random walks on graphs. We analyse the segregation of synthetic systems and large metropolitan areas in the US and the UK and our results confirm that the spatial variance and local diversity as measured through simple diffusion on graphs provides meaningful insights about the spatial organisation of ethnicities across a city.","tags":["Segregation","Networks","Random walks","Diffusion"],"title":"Quantifying ethnic segregation in cities through random walks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aleix Bassolas","Sandro Sousa","Vincenzo Nicosia"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature.

We propose a model to quantify the dynamic segregation of ethnicities in a city, based on passage times and coverage times of random walks on graphs. The results confirm that knowing where people commute to, rather than where they live, is potentially much more important to contain and curb the spreading of infectious diseases.","tags":["COVID-19","Ethnic segregation","Human mobility","Networks","Random walks","Urban systems"],"title":"Diffusion segregation and the disproportionate incidence of COVID-19 in African American communities","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1490572800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1490572800,"objectID":"18943ba72681a5af669c11972459cc83","permalink":"https://sandrofsousa.github.io/project/segreg/","publishdate":"2017-03-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/segreg/","section":"project","summary":"An open source plugin to compute spatial and non-spatial segregation measures on QGIS.","tags":["Segregation","QGIS"],"title":"QGIS Segreg","type":"project"}]
