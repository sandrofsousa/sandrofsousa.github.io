His research lies on quantifying the heterogeneity of spatially-embedded systems through random walks on graphs with particular interest on socio-economic segregation.\nPreviously he had worked as a research associate on a project between Brazilian and British academics entitled RESOLUTION where the cities of London and São Paulo were compared in respect to social segregation and transport accessibility. His MSc involved the use of a graph-based approach to quantify the topology changes of Sao Paulo’s public transport network over different spatial scales while tested the robustness of the system over simulated attacks. Before joining the research career, he had completed a postgraduate course in Business intelligence and had worked in the Information Technology field for more than 7 years.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://sandrofsousa.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"Sandro Sousa is computer scientist interested in emergent phenomena in complex systems, networks, segregation dynamics, urban transportation as well as a graph and data driven quantification of these phenomena.\nCurrently, he is a PhD Candidate in Complex Systems at School of Mathematical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London, with supervision by Vincenzo Nicosia.
