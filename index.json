His research lies on quantifying the heterogeneity of spatial systems through random walks on graphs with a particular interest on urban segregation.\nPreviously he had worked as a research associate on a project between Brazilian and British academics entitled RESOLUTION where the cities of London and São Paulo were compared for social segregation and transport accessibility. His MSc used a graph-based approach to quantify topological changes in Sao Paulo’s public transport network at different spatial scales while tested the robustness of the system against simulated attacks. Before the research career, he worked on IT consulting and data solutions for more than 7 years.\n  Download my resumé.\n","date":1611705600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1611705600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://sandrofsousa.github.io/author/sandro-sousa/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/sandro-sousa/","section":"authors","summary":"Sandro is a computer scientist interested in spatial complexity, random walks on graphs, population dynamics, urban segregation, mobility and the quantification of these phenomena through graphs and data models.\nCurrently, he is a PhD Candidate in Complex Systems at School of Mathematical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London, with supervision by Vincenzo Nicosia.","tags":null,"title":"Sandro Sousa","type":"authors"},{"authors":["Aleix Bassolas","Andrea Santoro","Sandro Sousa","Silvia Rognone","Vincenzo Nicosia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614211200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614211200,"objectID":"aa859187c0477550a4603bbf9ca86c22","permalink":"https://sandrofsousa.github.io/publication/pnas/","publishdate":"2021-02-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pnas/","section":"publication","summary":"We tackle the problem of quantifying the effectiveness of digital contact-tracing (CT) in containing the spreading of a non-airborne disease, like SARS-COV-2. We moved from the observation that the adoption rate of digital contact tracing apps during the COVID-19 pandemic has been generally pretty low (between 5\\% and 20\\% of the population in Western countries), and that the strategy\" used by governments to encourage people to install contact-tracing apps effectively corresponds to selecting those individuals uniformly at random.","tags":["Covid-19","SIR","Contact tracing","Optimal mitigation","Dynamics on networks"],"title":"Optimising the mitigation of epidemic spreading through targeted adoption of contact tracing apps","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aleix Bassolas","Sandro Sousa","Vincenzo Nicosia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1611705600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611705600,"objectID":"3a33752a59b3c5855c4b30899b072b06","permalink":"https://sandrofsousa.github.io/publication/jrsinterface/","publishdate":"2021-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jrsinterface/","section":"publication","summary":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemics disproportionately affects people from Black and African American backgrounds. We propose a model to quantify the dynamic segregation of ethnicities in a city, based on passage times and coverage times of random walks on graphs.

We propose two non-parametric measures of spatial variance and local spatial diversity, based on the statistical properties of the trajectories of random walks on graphs. We analyse the segregation of synthetic systems and large metropolitan areas in the US and the UK and our results confirm that the spatial variance and local diversity as measured through simple diffusion on graphs provides meaningful insights about the spatial organisation of ethnicities across a city.","tags":["Segregation","Networks","Random walks","Diffusion"],"title":"Quantifying ethnic segregation in cities through random walks","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1490572800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1490572800,"objectID":"18943ba72681a5af669c11972459cc83","permalink":"https://sandrofsousa.github.io/project/segreg/","publishdate":"2017-03-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/segreg/","section":"project","summary":"An open source plugin to compute spatial and non-spatial segregation measures on QGIS.","tags":["Segregation","QGIS"],"title":"QGIS Segreg","type":"project"}]
