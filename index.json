As a solution-oriented thinker, he applies an array of skills including network analysis, data science, computational and mathematical modeling, web scraping, spatial analysis, surveys, and controlled experiments to conduct research impactful to society.\nCurrently, he is a Postdoc in the NEtwoRks, Data, and Society Group (NERDS) at IT University of Copenhagen and a visiting Postdoc at (SODAS). His research concentrates on quantifying inequalities in Science through randomised controlled experiments and analysis of large datasets of academic publications.\nHe has a PhD in Complex Systems at The School of Mathematical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London, with supervision by Vincenzo Nicosia. His PhD research focused on quantifying the heterogeneity of spatial systems through random walks on graphs with a particular interest on urban segregation. Previously he had worked as a research associate on a project between Brazilian and British academics entitled RESOLUTION where the cities of London and São Paulo were compared for social segregation and transport accessibility. His MSc used a graph-based approach to quantify topological changes in Sao Paulo’s public transport network at different spatial scales while tested the robustness of the system against simulated attacks. Before the research career, he worked on IT consulting and data solutions for more than 7 years.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://sandrofsousa.github.io/author/sandro-sousa/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/sandro-sousa/","section":"authors","summary":"Sandro is a multidisciplinary researcher grounded in complexity science and systems thinking.

Novel methods of quantifying spatial tumour data at the cellular scale are required to link evolutionary dynamics to the resulting spatial architecture of the tumour. Here, we propose a framework using first passage times of random walks to quantify the complex spatial patterns of tumour cell population mixing. First, using a simple model of cell mixing we demonstrate how first passage time statistics can distinguish between different pattern structures. We then apply our method to simulated patterns of mutated and non-mutated tumour cell population mixing, generated using an agent-based model of expanding tumours, to explore how first passage times reflect mutant cell replicative advantage, time of emergence and strength of cell pushing. Finally, we explore applications to experimentally measured human colorectal cancer, and estimate parameters of early sub-clonal dynamics using our spatial computational model. We infer a wide range of sub-clonal dynamics, with mutant cell division rates varying between 1 and 4 times the rate of non-mutated cells across our sample set. Some mutated sub-clones emerged after as few as 100 non-mutant cell divisions, and others only after 50,000 divisions. The majority were consistent with boundary driven growth or short-range cell pushing. By analysing multiple sub-sampled regions in a small number of samples, we explore how the distribution of inferred dynamics could inform about the initial mutational event. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of first passage time analysis as a new methodology in spatial analysis of solid tumour tissue, and suggest that patterns of sub-clonal mixing can provide insights into early cancer dynamics.","tags":["Cancers and neoplasms","Colorectal cancer","Random walks","Diffusion on networks","Agent-based modeling"],"title":"First passage time analysis of spatial mutation patterns reveals evolutionary dynamics of pre-existing resistance in colorectal cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sandro Sousa","Vincenzo Nicosia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1664755200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664755200,"objectID":"17fa9b5d4a186f4edb3458ebc6520acf","permalink":"https://sandrofsousa.github.io/publication/natcomm/","publishdate":"2022-10-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/natcomm/","section":"publication","summary":"Socioeconomic segregation is one of the main factors behind the emergence of large-scale inequalities in urban areas.
