[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Sandro Sousa is computer scientist interested in emergent phenomena in complex systems, spatial networks, population dynamics, segregation and mobility as well as a graph and data driven quantification of these phenomena.\nCurrently, he is a PhD Candidate in Complex Systems at School of Mathematical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London, with supervision by Vincenzo Nicosia. His research lies on quantifying the heterogeneity of spatially-embedded systems through random walks on graphs with particular interest on urban segregation.\nPreviously he had worked as a research associate on a project between Brazilian and British academics entitled RESOLUTION where the cities of London and São Paulo were compared in respect to social segregation and transport accessibility. His MSc involved the use of a graph-based approach to quantify the topology changes of Sao Paulo’s public transport network over different spatial scales while tested the robustness of the system over simulated attacks. Before joining the research career, he had completed a postgraduate course in Business intelligence and had worked in the Information Technology field for more than 7 years.\n  Download my resumé.\n","date":1611705600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1611705600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://sandrofsousa.github.io/author/sandro-sousa/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/sandro-sousa/","section":"authors","summary":"Sandro Sousa is computer scientist interested in emergent phenomena in complex systems, spatial networks, population dynamics, segregation and mobility as well as a graph and data driven quantification of these phenomena.","tags":null,"title":"Sandro Sousa","type":"authors"},{"authors":["Aleix Bassolas","Andrea Santoro","Sandro Sousa","Silvia Rognone","Vincenzo Nicosia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614211200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614211200,"objectID":"aa859187c0477550a4603bbf9ca86c22","permalink":"https://sandrofsousa.github.io/publication/pnas/","publishdate":"2021-02-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pnas/","section":"publication","summary":"We tackle the problem of quantifying the effectiveness of digital contact-tracing (CT) in containing the spreading of a non-airborne disease, like SARS-COV-2. We moved from the observation that the adoption rate of digital contact tracing apps during the COVID-19 pandemic has been generally pretty low (between 5\\% and 20\\% of the population in Western countries), and that the strategy\" used by governments to encourage people to install contact-tracing apps effectively corresponds to selecting those individuals uniformly at random.","tags":["Covid-19","SIR","Contact tracing","Optimal mitigation","Dynamics on networks"],"title":"Optimising the mitigation of epidemic spreading through targeted adoption of contact tracing apps","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aleix Bassolas","Sandro Sousa","Vincenzo Nicosia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1611705600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611705600,"objectID":"3a33752a59b3c5855c4b30899b072b06","permalink":"https://sandrofsousa.github.io/publication/jrsinterface/","publishdate":"2021-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jrsinterface/","section":"publication","summary":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemics disproportionately affects people from Black and African American backgrounds.

We propose two non-parametric measures of spatial variance and local spatial diversity, based on the statistical properties of the trajectories of random walks on graphs. We analyse the segregation of synthetic systems and large metropolitan areas in the US and the UK and our results confirm that the spatial variance and local diversity as measured through simple diffusion on graphs provides meaningful insights about the spatial organisation of ethnicities across a city.","tags":["Segregation","Networks","Random walks","Diffusion"],"title":"Quantifying ethnic segregation in cities through random walks","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1490572800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1490572800,"objectID":"18943ba72681a5af669c11972459cc83","permalink":"https://sandrofsousa.github.io/project/segreg/","publishdate":"2017-03-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/segreg/","section":"project","summary":"An open source plugin to compute spatial and non-spatial segregation measures on QGIS.","tags":["Segregation","QGIS"],"title":"QGIS Segreg","type":"project"}]
